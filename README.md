# rockpaperscissors

### Objective
- Test whether a different repo can be published as a GitHub Pages site  
  - In https://github.com/mestonecoa/rockpaperscissors/settings/pages, select Branch as **main** and folder as **/root** (a must!)
  - The repository name is automatically used as the **path** — so the site is available at `mestonecoa.github.io/rockpaperscissors/`
- Test what happens if the repository name is changed  
  - Changed `rockpaperscissors` to `rps` → the path changed to `mestonecoa.github.io/rps/`  
  - Switched it back after testing
